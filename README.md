### Tips for Walking your Dog

- Avoid other dogs and people if your dog has a tendency to jump  (this can be fixed with gradual introduction to stimulus )
- Always carry extra bags you never know! 
- Switch it up every once and a while , dogs like to smell new things 
- Check the pavement or the ground to make sure its not too cold or too hot on their paws
- Consider boots or sweaters for you dog if the weather is cold or ground is not ideal
